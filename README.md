# MCP_Workshop_Updates
This repository is a curated collection of intelligent automations, API integrations, and developer workflows built during the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Workshop conducted by Nxtwave.  The workshop was an intense deep dive into modern automation stacks, blending code, no-code tools, and AI-driven development environments like Cursor IDE, Pipedream, and OpenAPI-compatible services to build systems that are lean, fast, and massively scalable.Inside this repository, you'll discover multiple real-world automation scenarios, each designed to solve a specific problem, optimize a repetitive task, or integrate disconnected services using the most cutting-edge tools available.
